This project implements the deep learning architectures from [You et al. 2017](http://sustain.stanford.edu/crop-yield-analysis/) and applies them to developing countries with significant agricultural productivity (Argentina, Brazil, India).

We also examine the efficacy of transfer learning of yield forecasting insights between adjoining countries; some results will appear in the proceedings of [COMPASS 2018](https://acmcompass.org/program/).
